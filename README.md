# TypeScript Type Guard Issue with null and undefined

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with type guards and null or undefined values in TypeScript. The issue arises when a function expects a string but may receive null or undefined, causing a runtime error if not handled correctly. 

The `bug.ts` file contains the original code with the error, while `bugSolution.ts` demonstrates the corrected code using a more robust type guard.
